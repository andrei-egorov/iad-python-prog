The repetition operator duplicates a tuple and links all of them together. Even though tuples are immutable, this can be extended to them. Просто отметить, что в этом контексте это называется sring repetition operator."

    "Is there any destructor in Python?\n",
    "Ans. Destructors are called when an object gets destroyed. Python has a garbage collector that handles memory management automatically. The __del__() method is known as a destructor method in Python. It is called when all references to the object have been deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Python Garbage collector works?\n",
    "Ans. Python deletes unwanted objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. Python’s garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object’s reference count reaches zero. An object’s reference count changes as the number of aliases that points changes. An object’s reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary). The object’s reference count decreases when it’s deleted with del, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope. When an object’s reference count reaches zero, Python collects it automatically. You can also call del () to delete the unused object."
